# Stock-Analysis
## Analysis of stock using VBA
##### Overview of Project
Steve needed a quick and easy way to compare stocks.  Using VBA, we are easily able to provide Steve with a tool to easily check on stock performance based on the year he chooses to see the data.
In this module, we created the necessary VBA coding to show Steve what he is looking for to analyze stock performance.  We also learned how to refactor the code to try and get the Macro to run at better performance levels.  This will be helpful if the data set is increased over time and Steve needs the macro to run smoothly each time it is performed.
